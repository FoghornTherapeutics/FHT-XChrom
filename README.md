# Overview
Why compare RNAseq and ATACseq? RNAseq profiles genomic mRNA expression, while ATACseq profiles sites of open chromatin where gene regulatory proteins bind. Combining gene expression and open chromatin allows correlation of gene expression changes with local chromatin changes,  highlighting the specific promoters and enhancers that potentially drive observed changes in gene expression.

By combining RNAseq and ATACseq, we can ask:
* Which gene expression changes correspond to local chromatin changes?
* Which gene expression changes are caused by chromatin changes induced by BAF inhibition (a chromatin modifier), and which changes are secondary?
* What biological pathways are impacted by chromatin accessibility loss induced by BAF inhibition?
